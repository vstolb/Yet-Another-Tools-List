### Brute Forcing and Dictionary Password Attacks

Tool | Description
---- | ----
[CeWL](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/cewl) 			| CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.
[THC Hydra](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra)								| Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack.
[Patator](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/patator)								| Patator is a multi-purpose password brute-forcer and fuzzer, with a modular design and a flexible usage. 
[Crawbar](https://github.com/galkan/crowbar)								| Crowbar (formally known as Levye) is a brute forcing tool that can be used during penetration tests. It was developed to brute force some protocols in a different manner according to other popular brute forcing tools. As an example, while most brute forcing tools use username and password for SSH brute force, Crowbar uses SSH key(s). This allows for any private keys that have been obtained during penetration tests, to be used to attack other SSH servers.
